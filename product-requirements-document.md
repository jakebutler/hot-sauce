# Step Tracker POC - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for a proof-of-concept mobile step tracking application designed to validate HealthKit integration and establish a replicable development process for future iOS apps. The primary goal is successful App Store deployment while demonstrating seamless integration with native iOS health data.

## Product Vision & Strategy

### Purpose
- **Primary Goal**: Validate HealthKit integration and create a replicable development workflow
- **Success Metric**: Successful App Store submission and approval
- **Target Developer**: Intermediate vibe coder looking for rapid iteration capabilities

### Value Proposition
A minimal, focused step tracking app that demonstrates:
- Seamless HealthKit integration
- Clean, native iOS user experience
- Rapid development workflow suitable for future projects

## Technology Stack Evaluation & Recommendations

### Frontend Framework: **React Native with Expo** ✅
**Rationale:**
- **Vibe Coding Friendly**: Hot reload, excellent developer experience, extensive debugging tools
- **Cross-platform Ready**: Native iOS now, Android expansion later without code rewrite
- **Active Community**: Largest React Native ecosystem with extensive documentation
- **Native Integration**: Excellent library support for iOS-specific features
- **HealthKit Support**: `react-native-health` library provides comprehensive HealthKit integration

**Alternative Considered:**
- **Flutter**: Good cross-platform support but smaller iOS-specific library ecosystem
- **Native iOS (SwiftUI)**: Best performance but no Android path and steeper learning curve

### Backend: **Supabase** ✅
**Rationale:**
- **Rapid Setup**: Authentication, database, and real-time features out-of-the-box
- **Vibe Coding Optimized**: Excellent developer experience with instant APIs
- **Built-in Auth**: Robust authentication system with social logins
- **PostgreSQL**: Reliable, scalable database with real-time subscriptions
- **Free Tier**: Suitable for POC development and testing

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Convex**: Excellent developer experience but newer ecosystem
- **Rails**: More setup overhead, not optimized for mobile-first development

### Additional Technology Decisions:
- **Analytics**: Firebase Analytics (free, comprehensive, easy Expo integration)
- **Crash Reporting**: Sentry (excellent React Native support)
- **State Management**: React Context API + useState (sufficient for MVP scope)
- **Navigation**: React Navigation v6 (industry standard)
- **Styling**: StyleSheet + Flexbox (native React Native approach)

## User Stories & Requirements

### Core User Flows

**Authentication Flow:**
- As a user, I can create a new account with email/password
- As a user, I can sign into my existing account
- As a user, I remain logged in between app sessions

**HealthKit Integration Flow:**
- As a user, I am prompted for HealthKit permissions on first app use
- As a user, I can grant read access to step count data
- As a user, the app gracefully handles permission denial

**Main Dashboard Flow:**
- As a user, I see my current day's step count prominently displayed
- As a user, the step count updates automatically throughout the day
- As a user, I can navigate to view my step history

**History View Flow:**
- As a user, I can view a chronological list of my daily step counts
- As a user, I see each day displayed with its corresponding step count
- As a user, I can navigate back to the main dashboard

## Technical Requirements

### iOS Native Requirements
- **Target iOS Version**: iOS 14.0+ (broad compatibility)
- **HealthKit Framework**: Full integration with step count data
- **App Store Guidelines**: Compliance with all iOS app requirements
- **Privacy**: Proper HealthKit usage description and permission handling

### Performance Requirements
- **Load Time**: Dashboard loads in <2 seconds
- **Data Sync**: Step counts update within 30 seconds of HealthKit changes
- **Offline Handling**: Graceful degradation when network unavailable

### Security Requirements
- **Authentication**: Secure user session management
- **Data Privacy**: HealthKit data never stored on external servers
- **API Security**: Proper authentication tokens and HTTPS only

## User Interface Specifications

### Design Principles
- **iOS Native Feel**: Follows iOS Human Interface Guidelines
- **Minimal & Clean**: Focus on core functionality
- **Accessibility**: VoiceOver support and proper contrast ratios

### Screen Specifications

**Dashboard Screen:**
- Large, prominent step count display (primary focus)
- Current date indicator
- "View History" navigation button
- Account/settings access

**History Screen:**
- List view with date and step count per row
- Scroll functionality for extended history
- Back navigation to dashboard

**Authentication Screens:**
- Standard email/password login form
- Account creation form
- Password reset functionality

## Data Architecture

### User Data Model
```
User {
  id: UUID
  email: string
  created_at: timestamp
  last_active: timestamp
}
```

### Step Data Handling
- **Source**: HealthKit (read-only access)
- **Local Storage**: Minimal caching for offline display
- **Server Storage**: User metadata only, no health data

## Development Milestones

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- [ ] React Native + Expo project setup
- [ ] Supabase backend configuration
- [ ] Basic navigation structure
- [ ] Authentication implementation

### Phase 2: HealthKit Integration (Week 2)
- [ ] HealthKit permissions implementation
- [ ] Step count data retrieval
- [ ] Dashboard UI with step display
- [ ] Error handling for permission denial

### Phase 3: Polish & Deploy (Week 3)
- [ ] History screen implementation
- [ ] Analytics and crash reporting integration
- [ ] iOS app store preparation
- [ ] Testing and bug fixes
- [ ] App Store submission

## Success Metrics

### Technical Validation
- [ ] Successful HealthKit data retrieval
- [ ] Smooth authentication flow
- [ ] Crash-free user experience
- [ ] App Store approval

### Development Process Validation
- [ ] Rapid iteration capability demonstrated
- [ ] Reusable code patterns established
- [ ] Documentation for future projects
- [ ] Developer experience feedback collected

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **HealthKit Rejection**: Mitigate with thorough privacy policy and minimal data usage
- **App Store Approval**: Follow guidelines strictly, prepare detailed app description
- **Performance Issues**: Regular testing on physical devices

### Development Risks
- **Timeline Overrun**: Prioritize core features, defer nice-to-haves
- **Learning Curve**: Leverage community resources and documentation

## Future Considerations

### Planned Expansions
- Android version using same React Native codebase
- Additional HealthKit metrics (heart rate, workouts)
- Data visualization and trends
- Goal setting and achievements

### Technical Debt Management
- Regular dependency updates
- Code review and refactoring cycles
- Performance monitoring and optimization
